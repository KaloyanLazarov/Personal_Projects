Hello, 
this is my GitHub repository with my personal projects, which I have created thoughout the time.

I am Kaloyan Lazarov, 19 year old student, studying Applied Mathematics and Informatics. My interests lie in solving problems involving data structures and algorithms. Finding simple solutions to complex problems is what I am trying to improve myself on. 
I am also interested in Big Data and using the tools of Machine Learning to harness information.
I have used Linux, MacOS and Windows, currently using MacOS. I liked the versatility of Linux, the ease-of-use of MacOS and really enjoyed the time when I migrated from Windows. 

My repository will remain public. If somebody wants to chat about code I wrote or Computer Science in general, I am open for discussion. 


first_project.py is something I wrote almost 2 years ago, when I first met Error and Exception Handling. I tried to make the game in such way, so it handles correctly everything the user might input. Looking back on it my Control Flow is not perfect but it is not as bad as i thought it would be.


InformaticsII is my university project. I had to write an algorithm which plays the game Bulls and Cows (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_Cows). The game is simple and because of that I tried to keep the code in CowsAndBullsGame.py as simple as possible. The code could be shorter is I used a 'set', but I decided against it. 

After I created the back-end of the game I create the GUI. Using Tkinter turned out to be more dificult than I expected, but after reading a lot of documentation and using StackOverflow, of course, I made a usable GUI. The *Restart* button is not working. 
The game was playable and I tried to play it myself. I was really bad, could not find the number for a really long time. I got better with time, but I never mastered the game to a level, where I can develop a good algorithm.

On TheAlgorithm.py I spent the most time, tried aproaching the problem using a Decision Tree, but without enough knowledge this lead me to a dead end. 
So I decided to use a more simple approach, using logic to narrow down a list of possible solutions, which eventually lead me to finding the secret number. 
The Algorithm knows what to do when it sees only cows, but when bulls get involved... There is definetely room for improvement there. 

The Projects is not quite finished, I got really sick the last couple of days in development and could not fix couple of things with the GUI and find better logic when a guessed number does not produce cows only.
