Hello, 
this is my GitHub repository with my personal projects, which I have created throughout the time.

I am Kaloyan Lazarov, 20 year old student, studying Applied Mathematics and Informatics. My interests lie in solving problems involving data structures and algorithms. Finding simple solutions to complex problems is what I am trying to improve myself on. 
I am also interested in Big Data and using the tools of Machine Learning to harvest information.
I have used Linux, MacOS and Windows, currently using MacOS. I liked the versatility of Linux, the ease-of-use of MacOS and really enjoyed the time when I migrated from Windows. 

My repository will remain public. If somebody wants to chat about code I wrote or Computer Science in general, I am open for discussion. For more information on my projects, you can check them individually. 

Currently Learning: SQL, SQLite3
